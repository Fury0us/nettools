# NETTOOLS
-  Automated all-in-one penetration testing kit for Debian based distributions
-  basic penetration testing tasks with automated interactive script
-  future updates will include multi-dist support

## Installation
- (INST) installation is simple,
- first, you must make sure you have basic dependencies installed such as
'git' and
'wget'.
- most dependencies should compile upon running certain script options.
- next, run the command:
git clone https://github.com/Fury0us/nettools
- if the first command doesnt work, run this command:
git clone https://github.com/Fury0us/nettools/

## Running the script
- change directory:
cd nettools
- then just simply run:
sudo bash nettools.sh

## Options
there are a plethora of options, too many to list here, but trust me when i say it includes everything,
and i mean EVERYTHING youll need to conduct a penetration test and automate tasks.

## Future updates
updates will come in perpetuity unless something changes in my life (seriously doubt it) and i will continue to 
work on this script and add compatibility features as i see fit, of course suggestions are encrouaged, 
as i am in all regards still a beginner.

## credits
shoutout to the creators of all the amazing tools that this script can take advantage of,
i wouldnt have the inspiration i have today if it wasnt for everyone that has and 
continues to influence the cybersecurity world today

## DISCLAIMER
i am in no way, shape, or form, responsible for any of the actions taken in use of this script, 
it is merely a tool and is meant to be used professionally and with express written permission
from the company/entity for which the penetration test is to be performed. Happy Hacking!
